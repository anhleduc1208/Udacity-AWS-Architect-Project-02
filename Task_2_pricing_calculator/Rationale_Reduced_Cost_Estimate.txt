To optimize to cost, I choose to update on these resources:

- Database: Switch from AWS RDS for MySQL to AWS Aurora MySQL compatible
- EC2: Change type from OnDemand to Reserved Instance for smaller cost
- S3: Setup lifecircle policy to store and archive infrequent access object to another class (S3 - IA, S3 Glacier)
